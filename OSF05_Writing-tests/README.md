# OSF05: Writing tests and modularizing your code

In this workshop, we will learn about the importance of testing your code to
ensure that there are no bugs or unexpected errors when running them. By the
end of this course, you'll learn the following:

* Modularizing your code so that they become "test-friendly"
* Difference between unit tests and integration tests
* Writing and running tests in Python using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework
* Program robustness via code coverage (not always the case!)

For today, we'll train a very simple machine learning model on a toy image
dataset (MNIST). Testing on ML is pretty challenging, since the latter involves
a large amount of uncertainty.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have the following installed:

* click
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pytest
