# TM Open-Source Fridays 

This repository contains all materials for OSF!

**What is OSF?** [Open-source fridays](https://opensourcefriday.com/) is a
biweekly workshop for learning the ins and outs of open-source software
development. It aims to skill you up as an open-source contributor!

We do not expect any software engineering experience (although they will
certainly help) as we go through these workshops, so feel free to join along!

## Topics

| # | Topic                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Difficulty                    |
|---|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Writing your first Pull Request          | Pull Requests (PRs) are vital to participate in open-source. In this workshop, you'll learn how the open-source workflow works and then make your first pull request!                                    | :octocat:                     |
| 2 | Reviewing other's code                   | Reviewing and reading others' code is an important skill in open-source. In this workshop, we'll teach you how to review others' code as we help port old stories into the new TM website!               | :octocat:                     |
| 3 | TM Code standards and pre-commits        | We follow a certain code standard in Thinking Machines. To enforce that, we recommend the use of pre-commits. Today, you'll learn about the pre-commit workflow and set-up pre-commits in your computer. | :octocat:                     |
| 4 | Structuring your repository              | If you want                                                                                                                                                                                              | :octocat: :octocat:           |
| 5 | Writing tests and modularizing your code |                                                                                                                                                                                                          | :octocat: :octocat: :octocat: |
