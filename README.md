# TM Open-Source Fridays 

This repository contains all materials for OSF!

**What is OSF?** [Open-source fridays](https://opensourcefriday.com/) is a
biweekly workshop for learning the ins and outs of open-source software
development. It aims to skill you up as an open-source contributor!

We do not expect any software engineering experience (although they will
certainly help) as we go through these workshops, so feel free to join along!

## Topics

* OSF01: Creating your first Pull Request!
* OSF02: Reviewing other's code
* OSF03: TM Code Standards and using pre-commits
* OSF04: Structuring your repository
* OSF05: Writing tests

*..and more!*
